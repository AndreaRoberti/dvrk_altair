The content of this directory has been moved to a different repository.  From now on, each dVRK site should have their own repository for their configurations files.  All configuration files repositories can be hosted under: https://github.com/dvrk-config/dvrk_config_jhu

The new repository for the JHU systems is: https://github.com/dvrk-config/dvrk_config_jhu

If you're using ROS1 and retrieved all the dVRK repositories with `wstool`, the files are under:
`<your-worspace>/src/dvrk_config_jhu`

If you're using ROS2 and retrieved all the dVRK repositories with `vcs`, the files are under:
`<your-workspace>/src/dvrk/dvrk_config_jhu`
