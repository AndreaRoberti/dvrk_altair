1.6.0 (2018-05-16)
==================

* API changes:
  * All classes with `osa` and `mts` levels have been merged to simplify code

* Bug fixes:
  * Interval statistics were base on the "Read" phase only, it was missing the PID computing time as well as "Write" to IO
  * Qt widget: brake control requires "direct control"
